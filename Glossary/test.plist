        The IATA 3-letter airport codes uniquely identify individual airports worldwide. They are made up of precisely 3 letters - numerals are not allowed.
        Current APIS data collection requirements are the biographical information contained in the machine-readable zone (MRZ) of a passport: full name, date of birth, gender, nationality and country from which the passport was issued. These data elements are the same regardless of destination, citizenship or transfer airport. However, other nations with APIS programs could require variable data element requirements based on ICAO/WCO adopted standards. Each nation is being encouraged by ICAO to adopt only those data elements that reside within the MRZ of the passport.</string>

A connecting (transfer) itinerary will have at least 2 segments.  A direct/non-stop itinerary only has one segment.</string>
	<key>Segment Limit</key>
