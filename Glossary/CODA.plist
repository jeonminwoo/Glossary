    <key>Rule 85</key>
    <string>Rule 85 is the term used in reference to Article 85 of the Contract of Carriage. It is the reaccommodation plan used when a specific flight is:
        
        -Delayed more than 15 minutes
        -Cancelled
        -Diverted and the Customers were not advised of the possible diversion
        
        Under Rule 85:
        
        Transport the Customer at no additional charge on our next flight(s) on which space is available to the intended destination (or point of origin) in accordance with SWA reaccommodation practices.
        
        If the Customer requests a refund, provide a refund of the unused portion of the ticket, in accordance with Rule 90, regardless of the fare restrictions.
        
        NOTE: If the Customer opts to rebook for a later time rather than take the next available flight or request a refund, follow the 14-Day Reaccommodation Guidelines.
        
        Rule 85 does not allow you to:
        
        -Waive fare restrictions simply to allow Customers to travel on earlier flights.
        
        -Reaccommodate Customers in a missed flight situation who arrive at the airport within two hours after their scheduled departure time.
        
        Station Leadership can apply Rule 85 on a local basis during irregular operations or when there is advance notice that a flight has been cancelled. Station Leadership will contact the Customer Service Coordinator (CSC), who will consult with Dispatch and ensure that the information is added to the Dispatch Bulletin in the Direct Reference System (G/BUL/DIS/today's date).

    <key>TA Pools</key>
    <string>Terminal Addresses. LNIATA was originally a fixed address for a fixed terminal.
        With the advent of PCs, in the late 1980s, they were often connected to a gateway on a LAN. The PC connected to the gateway via NetBIOS , SPX/IPX or TCP/IP. The gateway used a card for the line protocol (ALC, P1024, X.25, etc). In some implementations, the gateway could hold a pool of available Terminal Addresses (TAs) and allocate them to PCs on a first-come / first-serve basis.
        When the Front End Processor (FEP) started supporting TCP/IP, using OFEP on VAX/VMS, a pooling capability was built into OFEP. Fixed addresses were still available and still used extensively today, particularly by travel agents. For NOFEP, built on Sun/Solaris, the pooling was moved into the host and the software package is known as TAM. The connection to NOFEP specifies a pool name, and the TA is allocated from that pool.</string>
