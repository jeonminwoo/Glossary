	<string>OASYS is the front end for the OTIS database. It is a web application that is used to audit flight data in OTIS and verify that it passes Southwest Airlines Audit Rules for time, fuel, PAX, etc.  When a Ground Ops Agent completes a flight in OTIS, the data is picked up by the OASYS process. If the data associated to the flight passes audit, then the flight data is passed on to the Flight Tracking System. If the data does not pass audit rules, then the flight is displayed on the OASYS screen and the FLIFO Agent at headquarters can validate the data and perform a manual audit on the flight data. Once the FLIFO agent saves the changes to the flight data, it is sent to Flight Tracking.</string>

	<string>Terminal Addresses. LNIATA was originally a fixed address for a fixed terminal.
        With the advent of PCs, in the late 1980s, they were often connected to a gateway on a LAN. The PC connected to the gateway via NetBIOS , SPX/IPX or TCP/IP. The gateway used a card for the line protocol (ALC, P1024, X.25, etc). In some implementations, the gateway could hold a pool of available Terminal Addresses (TAs) and allocate them to PCs on a first-come / first-serve basis.
        When the Front End Processor (FEP) started supporting TCP/IP, using OFEP on VAX/VMS, a pooling capability was built into OFEP. Fixed addresses were still available and still used extensively today, particularly by travel agents. For NOFEP, built on Sun/Solaris, the pooling was moved into the host and the software package is known as TAM. The connection to NOFEP specifies a pool name, and the TA is allocated from that pool.</string>

SODA does not provide an option for a refund.
        
        If a Customer is traveling within 14 days of the original day of travel, he/she may be confirmed in the original class of service; may be overbooked in the original class of service (if Y seats are available); or may travel standby if a seat cannot be confirmed.
        
        If the Customer is traveling more than 14 days following the original travel date, he/she may be confirmed in the original class of service (only if the same class of service is still available). If the fare has changed in the original class of service, the Customer must pay the difference in fare. Standby requires an upgrade to the Y fare. Overbooking in the original class of service (even if Y is available) is not permitted.
